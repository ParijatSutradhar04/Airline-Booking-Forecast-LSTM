This project was a part of a hackathon organised by Optima at IIT Kgp. 

A huge data was given pertaining to flight bookings, pertaining to revernue generated per day, etc.

The data was given for past 9 months, and the task was to predict the data for the next 3 months. This prediction would be used to set the most optimal selling price of tickets per day, so as to maximize revenue. It would also help to better plan the logistics for ticket booking.

The prediction was made considering a lot of parameters like time-series of number of tickets booked per day, revenue generated, and other datas like market capacity of an airline, etc.
